一,1,一①,一,"one, one radical (no.1)","In Chinese characters, the number one is laid on its side, unlike the Roman numeral i which stands upright. As you would expect, it is written from left to right. [1]",1,イチ、イツ
一,1,一②,一,One,"* as a primitive ELEMENT, the key-word meaning is discarded, and the single horizontal stroke takes on the meaning of floor or ceiling, depending on its position: if it stands above another primitive, it means ceiling; if below, floor.",,イチ、イツ
一,2,二,二,"two, two radical (no. 7)","Ì Like the Roman numeral ii, which reduplicates the numeral i, the kanji for two is a simple reduplication of the horizontal stroke that means one. The order of writing goes from above to below, with the First stroke slightly shorter. [2]",2,ニ、ジ
一,3,三,三,three,"X And like the Roman numeral iii, which triples the numeral i, the kanji for three simply triples the single horizontal stroke. In writing it, think of “1 + 2 = 3” (s + Ì = X) in order to keep the middle stroke shorter. [3]",3,サン、ゾウ
一,4,四,四,four,"This character is composed of two primitive elements, mouth S and human legs #, both of which we will meet in the coming Lessons. Assuming that you already knew how to write this kanji, we will pass over the “story” connected with it until later. Note how the second stroke is written left-to-right and then top-to-bottom. This is consistent with what we have already seen in the first three numbers and leads us to a general principle that will be helpful when we come to more complicated kanji later on: write north-to-south, west-to-east, northwest-to-southeast. [5]",5,シ
一,5,五,五,five,"As with four, we shall postpone learning the primitive elements that make up this character. Note how the general principle we just learned in the preceding frame applies to the writing of the character for five. [4]",4,ゴ

一,7,七②,七,"diced, i.e., “cut” into little pieces","* as a primitive, this form takes on the meaning of diced, i.e., “cut” into little pieces, consistent both with the way the character is written and with its association with the kanji for cut × to be learned in a later Lesson (frame 85).",,シチ
一,8,八,八,"eight, eight radical (no. 12)","Just as the Arabic numeral “8” is composed of a small circle followed by a larger one, so the kanji for eight is composed of a short line followed by a longer line, slanting towards it but not touching it. And just as the “lazy 8” % is the mathematical symbol for “in³nity,” so the expanse opened up below these two strokes is associated by the Japanese with the sense of an in³nite expanse or something “all-encompassing.” [2]",2,ハチ
一,9,円,円,"circle, yen, round","This kanji, also used for Yen, is one you are not likely to need to study formally, since you can hardly get around in Japan without it. The connection is that the yennies, like pennies, are circular in shape. In any case, the elements are: glass canopy . . . walking stick . . . one. [4]",4,エン
一,10,十①,十,ten,"* as a primitive, this character sometimes keeps its meaning of ten and sometimes signifies needle, this latter derived from the kanji for needle [(frame 274).

一,11,万,万,"ten thousand, 10,000","Japanese counts higher numbers in units of ten thousand, unlike the West, which advances according to units of one thousand. (Thus, for instance, 40,000 would be read “four ten thousand” by a Japanese.) Given that the comma is used in larger numbers to bind up a numerical unit of one thousand, the elements for one and bound up naturally come to form ten thousand. The order of strokes here needs special attention, both because it falls outside the general principles we have learned already, and because it involves writing the element for bound up in an order opposite to the one we learned. If it is any consolation, this exception is consistent every time these three strokes come together. [3]",3,マン、バン

世,1,世①,世,"generation, world, society, public","We generally consider one generation as a period of thirty (or ten plus ten plus ten) years. If you look at this kanji in its completed form—not in its stroke order—you will see three tens. When writing it, think of the lower horizontal lines as “addition” lines written under numbers to add them up. Thus: ten “plus” ten “plus” ten = thirty.

千,1,千①,千,thousand,"This kanji is almost too simple to pull apart, but for the sake of practice, have a look at the drop above and the ten below. Now put the elements together by thinking of squeezing two more zeros out of an eyedropper alongside the number ten to make it a thousand. [3]",3,セン
千,2,舌,舌,"tongue, reed, clapper","The primitive for mouth and the character for thousand naturally form the idea of tongue if one thinks of a thousand mouths able to speak the same language, or as we say, “sharing a common tongue.” It is easy to see the connection between the idiom and the kanji if you take its image literally: a single tongue being passed around from mouth to mouth.

千,5,活①,活,"lively, resuscitation, being helped, living","When we speak of a lively personality or a lively party, we immediately think of a lot of chatter. This kanji depicts the idea of lively by having tongues babble and splash around like flowing water. [9]",9,カツ

中,1,中①,中,"in, inside, middle, mean, Centre","The elements here are a walking stick and a mouth. Remember the trouble your mother had getting medicine in your mouth? Chances are it crossed her mind more than once to grab something handy, like your grandfather’s walking stick, to pry open your jaws while she performed her duty. Keep the image of getting something in from the outside, and the otherwise abstract sense of this key word should be a lot easier than trying to spoon castor oil into a baby’s mouth. [4]",4,チュウ

丶,1,丶①,丶,a drop of,"* a drop of , The meaning of this primitive is obvious from the first moment you look at it, though just what it will be a drop of will differ from case to case.

日,1,日①,日,"day, sun, Japan, counter for days","This kanji is intended to be a pictograph of the sun.

日,1,日②,日,sun or day or a tongue wagging in the mouth,"* Used as a primitive, this kanji can mean sun or day or a tongue wagging in the mouth. This latter meaning, incidentally, derives from an old character outside the standard list meaning something like “sayeth” and written almost exactly the same, except that the stroke in the middle does not touch the right side (Q, frame 578).",,ニチ、ジツ
日,2,旧,旧,"old times, old things, old friend, former, ex-","A walking stick is needed for days of olden times, since days, too, get old—at least insofar as we refer to them as the “good old days.” The main thing here is to think of “good old days” when you hear the key word olden times. The rest will take care of itself. [5]",5,キュウ
日,3,昌,昌,"prosperous, bright, clear","What we mentioned in the previous two frames about 3 of something meaning “everywhere” or “heaps of” was not meant to be taken lightly. In this kanji we see two suns, one atop the other, which, if we are not careful, is easily confused in memory with the three suns of sparkle. Focus on the number this way: since we speak of prosperous times as sunny, what could be more prosperous than a sky with two suns in it? Just be sure to actually see them there. [8]",8,
日,4,冒,冒,"companion, friend","Remember when you were young and your mother told you never to look directly into the sun for fear you might burn out your eyes? Probably you were foolish enough to risk a quick glance once or twice; but just as probably, you passed that bit of folk wisdom on to someone else as you grew older. Here, too, the kanji that has a sun above and an eye right below looking up at it has the meaning of risk (see frame 12). [9]",9,ボウ
日,5,唱,唱,"sparkle, clear, crystal","This one is easy! You have one mouth making no noise (the choirmaster) and two mouths with wagging tongues (the minimum for a chorus). So think of the key word, chant, as monastery singing and the kanji is yours forever (see frame 12). [11]",11,ショウ
日,6,晶,晶,"sparkle, clear, crystal","What else can the word sparkle suggest if not a diamond? And if you’ve ever held a diamond up to the light, you will have noticed how every facet of it becomes like a miniature sun. This kanji is a picture of a tiny sun in three places (that is, “everywhere”), to give the sense of something that sparkles on all sides. Just like a diamond. In writing the primitive elements three times, note again how the rule for writing given in frame 4 holds true not only for the strokes in each individual element but also for the disposition of the elements in the character as a whole.

白,1,白②,白,white bird or dove,"* as a primitive, this character can either retain its meaning of white or take the more graphic meaning of a white bird or dove. This latter stems from the fact that it appears at the top of the kanji for bird, which we shall get to later (frame 1941).",,ハク、ビャク

(Perhaps the opening scene of “The Sound of Music” will help.) Simply think of little springs bubbling up across the meadow to form a sort of path that leads you right to the brink of a precipitous cliff. Now if you can see Schwester Maria skipping along merrily, dodging in and out of the springs, and then falling headlong over the cliff, you have a ridiculous story that should help fix this kanji in memory.

原,2,源,源,"source, origin","With the advice of the last frame in mind, it is easy to see water and meadow in this character for source. Both in its etymology (it has a common parent with the word “surge”) and in popular usage, source suggests the place water comes from.

What all of this has to do with the gall bladder is not immediately clear. But if we give a slight twist to the traditional biblical advice about not letting the sun set on your anger (which ancient medicine associated with the choler or bile that the gall bladder is supposed to filter out), and change it to “not letting the night break on your anger” (or your gall), the work is done.

The meaning of this element is wide enough to embrace the horns of bulls, rams, billy goats, and moose, but not the family of musical instruments.

Anyway, if you let the word neck conjure up the image of a moose with a very l-o-n-g neck hanging over the fireplace, whose horns you use for a coat-rack and whose nose has spigots left and right for scotch and water, you should have no trouble with the character.

Atop we see the rice field, and below the element for land. Those four sections you see in the rice field (and which we made mention of when first we introduced the character in frame 14) are actually measurements of land, much the same as farm-sections in the United States have given us the notion of a “country mile.” The land division based on the size of a rice field is called a ri.

It is not the last time it will happen in this book, but I can assure you they are used only when absolutely necessary. One rin is equal to about 1/1000 of a yen—or rather was worth that much when it still made economic sense to mint them. While inflation took its toll on this kanji as a monetary unit, it survived with the not at all surprising sense of something “very, very tiny.” The kanji shows a cliff with a computer under it, apparently because it has been pushed over into the abyss by someone fed up with the thing. The total market value of one home computer that has fallen over rock and bramble for several hundred feet: about one rin! [9]",9,リン

It is the primitives with which one has to work that are the critical factor, as 2in this case where the meaning of the key word is so seemingly distant from the elements.

The related but less tame key word seduce was chosen because it seemed to fit better with the— how shall we put it?—Freudian implications of the kanji.

In fact, few people remain content with a single specialty and usually extend themselves in other fields as well. This is how we come to get the picture of ten fields glued together to represent a specialty. [9]",9,セン

Think of a Dr. who is a specialist with a needle (an acupuncturist) and let the drop at the top represent the period at the end of Dr. In principle we are trying to avoid this kind of device, which plays on abstract grammatical conventions; but I think you will agree, after you have had occasion to use the right side of this kanji in forming other kanji, that the exception is merited in this case.

Simply because a ruler bestows a noble name on a deed is hardly any consolation to the masses who must part with their hard-earned money.

The explanation makes “sense,” but is hard to remember because the word “beginning” is too abstract. Back up to the image we used two frames ago— Adam and Eve in their Eden—and try again: The root of all stubbornness goes back to the beginning, with two brothers each stubbornly defending his own way of life and asking their God to bless it favourably. Abel stuck to agriculture, Cain to animalraising. Picture these two with their giant, swelled heads, each vying for the favours of heaven, a stubborn grimace on their faces.

Now one who is possessed by shells is likely to abandon any higher principles to acquire more and more wealth. These are the easiest ones to bribe with a few extra shells. [13]",13,ワイ

石,1,石①,石,stone,"With a mouth under a cliff, what else could we have here but the entrance to a secret cavern, before which a great stone has been rolled so that none may enter. Perhaps it is the hiding place where Ali Baba and his band of thieves have stored their treasures, in which case that magic word known to every school child who ever delighted over the tales of the Arabian Nights should be enough to push the stone aside. But take care—the cliff is steep, and one slip will send you tumbling down into the ravine below. [5]

This is the one and only time that the second stroke in cliff will reach over to the middle of the horizontal stroke. If you think of the edge jutting outwards (in keeping with the story above), the problem should be taken care of.",5,セキ、シャク、コク
石,1,石②,石,stone or rocks of any size or shape,"* The stone is a quite common primitive element, which is not restricted to great boulders but used of stones or rocks of any size or shape.",,セキ、シャク、コク
石,2,硝②,硝,"nitrate, saltpeter","The word nitrate should immediately suggest a beaker of nitric acid, which, as every high-school chemistry student knows, can eat its way through some pretty tough substances.

了,1,了①,了,"complete, finish","Learn this character by returning to frame 95 and the image given there. The only difference is that the “arms” have been left off (actually, only tucked inside).

了,2,蒸,蒸,"steam, heat, sultry, foment, get musty","The flower at the top and the floor with the oven fire beneath are familiar. The problem is what comes in between. It is formed by the character for complete, whose vertical stroke doubles up as the first stroke of water. [13]",13,ジョウ、セイ
了,3,承,承,"acquiesce, hear, listen to, be informed, receive","The sense of passive acceptance or reception of information is contained in this key word.

子,1,子①,子,"child, sign of the rat, 11PM-1AM, first sign of Chinese zodiac",This kanji is a pictograph of a child wrapped up in one of those handy cocoons that Japanese mothers fix to their backs to carry around young children who cannot get around by themselves. The first stroke is like a wee head popping out for air; the second shows the body and legs all wrapped up; and the final stroke shows the arms sticking out to cling to the mother’s neck. [3],3,シ、ス、ツ

子,2,孔②,孔,"cavity, hole, slit, very, great, exceedingly","Probably the one thing most children fear more than anything else is the dentist’s chair. Once a child has seen a dentist holding the x-rays up to the light and heard that ominous word cavity, even though it is not likely to know that the word means “hole” until it is much older, it will not be long before those two syllables get associated with the drill and that row of shiny hooks the dentist uses to torture people who are too small to fight back.

子,3,厚,厚,"thick, heavy, rich, kind, cordial, brazen, shameless","When we refer to someone as thick-skinned or thick-headed, we are usually quick to add—even if only under our breath— something about their upbringing, since we cherish the belief that by nature people are basically tender and sensitive. The Japanese character for thick depicts a child abandoned out on the wild cliffs, exposed to the heat of the sun, and thus doomed to develop a head and skin as thick as the parent who left it there.

人,1,人②,人,person,"* as a primitive, it can keep its kanji form except when it appears to the left (its normal position), where it is made to stand up in the form l. The primitive meaning is another matter. The abstract notion of person so often has a relation to the meaning of the kanji that confusion readily sets in. So many of the previous stories have included people in them that simply to use person for a primitive meaning would be risky. We need to be more specific, to focus on one particular person. Try to choose someone who has not figured in the stories so far, perhaps a colourful member of the family or a friend whom you have known for a long time.

女,3,如,如,"likeness, like, such as, as if, better, best, equal","Pardon me if I revert to the venerable old Dr. Freud again, but his eye for symbolism is often helpful to appreciate things that more earthy imaginations once accepted more freely but that we have learned to cover over with a veneer of etiquette. For instance, the fact that things like the mouth of a cave served as natural ritual substitutes for the opening through which a woman gives birth. Hence, in order to be reborn as an adult, one may have to pass through the psychological equivalent of the womb, that is, something that bears a likeness to the opening of the woman from whom you were born.

What has to be noted particularly are the changes in shape the kanji can undergo when it becomes an element in other kanji. In fact, it is the most volatile of all the kanji we shall treat, and for that reason deserves special attention here.

* When it appears to the left, it looks like this: 7, and we shall take it to mean cloak. At the bottom, when attached to the stroke immediately above it, the first two strokes (the top hat) are omitted, giving us: R, which we shall take to mean a scarf.

* On rare occasions, the element can be torn right across the middle, with the first 2 strokes appearing at the top and the last 4 at the bottom of another primitive or cluster of primitives: S, in which cases we shall speak of a top hat and scarf.

* And finally, of course, it can keep its original kanji shape, along with its original meaning of garment in general.

⺡,3,沼,沼,"marsh, lake, bog, swamp, pond","Unlike the meadow with its cliffs, the marshlands are low and near a source of water that feeds them until they get soggy through and through. Why certain land becomes marshy is probably due to the fact that it felt thirsty, and so tried its best to seduce the water over to its side. But, like most inordinate seductions, the last state of the victim is worse than the first. Hence the slushy marsh. [8]",8,
⺡,4,江,江,"creek, inlet, bay","Unlike the river, the ocean, the lake, and the pond, the creek is often no more then a dribble of water trickling down a small gully. While the geological history of the larger bodies of water is hard to surmise sometimes, all of us know from our childhood how creeks are made. You probably even dug one or two in your time. All you need to do is find a mainstream of water somewhere and dig a little path into dry land. The creek is thus a Lesson in water-craft, as this kanji would agree. [6]",6,コウ
⺡,5,潮,潮,"tide, salt water, opportunity","Before we get to explaining this character, take a look at it and see if you can figure out the primitive elements on your own…. On the left is the water—that much is easy. On the right we have only one primitive, the kanji for morning learned back in frame 52. See how an apparently complex kanji falls apart neatly into manageable pieces? To get the meaning of the key word tide, just think of it in connection with the character for eventide that we learned back in frame 110. Here we have the morning-tide, its complement. By the way, if you missed the question about the number of primitives, it is probably because you forgot what we said earlier about kanji becoming primitives, independently of the pieces that make them up. as a rule, look for the largest kanji you can write and proceed from there to primitives stranded on their own. [15]",15,チョウ
⺡,6,況,況,"condition, situation","This key word is a connector used to link contrasting phrases and sentences together with much the same flavor as the English phrase but of course. Just picture yourself ready to go off on your first date as a teenager, and having your mother grill you about your manners and ask you embarrassing questions about your hygiene. “Did you have a good shower?” “But of course…,” you reply, annoyed. So water and teenager combine to give us but of course. [8]",8,キョウ
⺡,7,河,河,river,"The character in this frame represents a step up from the stream we met in frame 127; it is a full-sized river.

⺡,9,測,測,"fathom, plan, scheme, measure","Connoting the measurement of the depth of water, the key word fathom begins with the water primitive. To its right, we see the compound-primitive for rule (frame 88) which we learned in the sense of a “ruler” or “measure.” Hence, when we rule water we fathom it. What could be simpler? But be careful; its simplicity is deceptive. Be sure to picture yourself fathoming a body of water several hundred feet deep by using a ruler of gargantuan proportions. [12]",12,ソク
⺡,10,湖,湖,lake,"Water . . . old . . . flesh. You have heard of legends of people being abandoned in the mountains when they had become too old to work.

水,1,水①,水,water,"This character, which looks a bit like a snowflake, is actually a pictograph of water—not any particular body of water or movement of water, but simply the generic name for water. Should you have any difficulty remembering it, simply think of a walking stick being dropped vertically into the water, sending droplets out in all four directions. Then all you need to learn is how to write it in proper order. [4]",4,スイ
水,1,水②,水,water,"* as a primitive, this character can keep its form, or it can be written with three drops to the left of another primitive, like this: Y. This latter, as we will see, is far more common.",,スイ
水,2,氷,氷,"icicle, ice, hail, freeze, congeal","The appearance of the primitive for water in its full form tells us that we have something to do with water here. The extra drop to the left, added as a second stroke, changes the picture from a splash caused by a walking stick dropped into water to form an icicle. If you hold an icicle up to the light, you can usually see little crystallizations of five-pointed stars inside of it, which is the shape we have in this kanji. [5]",5,ヒョウ
水,3,泉③,泉,"spring, fountain","Call to mind the image of a fresh, bubbling spring of water, and you will probably notice how the top of the spring you are thinking of, the part where the “bubbling” goes on, is all white. Happily, the white is just where it should be, at the top, and the water is at the bottom. [9]",9,セン
水,3,水③,水,,,,
永,1,永①,永,"eternity, long, lengthy","This kanji also uses the full form of water, though its meaning seems to have nothing at all to do with water. Remember what William Blake said about seeing “infinity in a grain of sand and eternity in an hour”? Well, reading this character from top to bottom, we see “eternity in a drop of water.” [5]",5,エイ
永,2,泳,泳,swim,"The primitive to the left, you will recall from frame 130, represents water. To the right, we see the kanji for eternity. Knowing how much children like swimming, what could be a better image of eternal bliss than an endless expanse of water to swim in without a care in the world? [8]",8,エイ
永,2,永②,永,,,,
平,1,平①,平,"even, flat, peace","This character is easiest remembered as a pictograph of a water lily floating on the surface of the water, which gives it its meaning of even.

平,1,平②,平,water lily,"* as a primitive, this kanji can keep its pictographic meaning of a water lily.",,ヘイ、ビョウ、ヒョウ

平,3,坪,坪,"two-mat area, approx. thirty-six sq ft","This kanji belongs to an old Japanese system of measurement and indicates an area of about 36 square feet, or the area taken up by two tatami mats. Its elements: ground . . . water lily. [8]",8,ヘイ

土,1,土①,土,"soil, earth, ground, Turkey","I don’t like it any more than you do, but this kanji is not the pictograph it is trumped up to be: a mound of soil piled on the ground. All I can recommend is that you memorize it as it is. Anyway, it will be occurring with such frequency that you have almost no chance of forgetting it, even if you try. [3]",3,ド、ト
土,1,土②,土,"soil, dirt, land","* as a primitive, the sense of soil is extended to that of ground because of its connection with the kanji for the same (frame 515). From there it also takes the added meanings of dirt and land.",,ド、ト
土,2,吐,吐,"spit, vomit, belch, confess, tell (lies)",We have here a rather small mouth (it is always compressed when set on the left) next to a much larger piece of dirt. It is not hard to imagine what you might do if you got a mouth full of dirt. As least I know what I would do: spit it out as fast and far as I could! [6],6,ト
土,3,圧,圧,"pressure, push, overwhelm, oppress, dominate","One of the things that causes the erosion of soil is the excessive pressure of the topsoil on the lower soil. This can be caused by any number of things from heavy rainfall to heavy buildings to the absence of sufficient deep-rooted vegetation to hold the layers together. Here we see a steep cliff without a tree in sight. The slightest pressure on it will cause a landslide, which you can almost see happening in this character. [5]",5,アツ、エン、オウ
土,4,埼,埼,"cape, spit, promontory","The cape pictured here is a jut of land like Cape Cod. The soil on the left tells us we have to do with land, and the strange on the right tells us it is a cape where unusual things go on. Put a haunted house on it, an eerie sky overhead, and a howling wind rustling through the trees, and you have yourself a picture of Cape Strange (or, if you prefer, Cape Odd). [11]",11,
土,5,坦,坦,"level, wide","The hedge depicted in this frame is the miraculous hedge of briar roses that completely spanned the castle grounds in which Sleeping Beauty lay for a hundred years, so that none but her predestined beloved could find his way through it. [9]",9,
土,6,均,均,"level, average","The level this key word refers to is not the carpenter’s tool but rather the even surface of a thing. It pictures soil being scooped up into a ladle and then made level (apparently because one is measuring soil). The excess drops of soil are brushed off the top, which accounts for the added drop at the ladle’s edge. [7]",7,キン

寺,1,寺①,寺,Buddhist temple,"You have heard of people “attaching” themselves to a particular sect? Here is your chance to take that metaphor literally and imagine some fellow walking into a Buddhist temple with a fervent resolve to attach himself to the place. Since there is plenty of unused land around the precincts, he simply picks out a suitable patch, brushes the soles of his feet with glue, steps down firmly, and so join the Buddhist temple as a “permanent member.” [6]",6,ジ
寺,2,時,時,"time, hour","“What is time?” asked St. Augustine in his memoirs. “Ask me not, and I know. Ask me, and I cannot tell you.” Here we have the kanji’s answer to that perennial riddle. Time is a sun rising over a Buddhist temple. It sounds almost like a Zen kõan whose repetition might yield some deep secret to the initiated. At any rate, imagining a monk seated in meditation pondering it might help us remember the character. [10]",10,ジ
寺,2,寺②,寺,,,,
圭,1,圭①,圭,"square jewel, corner, angle, edge","Now I am going to do something unusual. The character in this frame is going to get one meaning and the primitive another, with no relation at all between the two. In time, I hope you will see how helpful this is. The kanji key word, square jewel, depicts a mammoth precious stone, several feet high, made by piling up large heaps of soil on top of one another. Not something you would want to present your betrothed on your wedding day, but a good image for remembering this rare character, used chiefly in personal names nowadays. [6]",6,ケイ、ケ
圭,1,圭②,圭,"ivy, that creepy vegetation that covers the surface of the ground to form a sort of “second” ground that can get somewhat tricky to walk on without tripping.","* as a primitive, we shall use this character to mean ivy, that creepy vegetation that covers the surface of the ground to form a sort of “second” ground that can get somewhat tricky to walk on without tripping.",,ケイ、ケ
圭,2,封,封,"seal, closing","Think of the key word seal as referring to a letter you have written and are preparing to close. Instead of using the traditional wax seal, you glue a sprig of ivy on the outside. In this way the elements ivy and glue give you a curious and memorable way to seal your secret letters. [9]",9,フウ、ホウ
圭,3,涯,涯,"horizon, shore, limit, bound","After seeing a constant horizon of water, water everywhere for months at sea, could there be anything more delightful to the eyes than to look astern and see the ivy-clad cliffs of land on a new horizon? Of course, you’d need the eyes of a stellar telescope to recognize that the vegetation was in fact ivy, but the phrase “ivy-clad cliffs” has such a nice ring to it that we won’t worry about such details.

火,1,火①,火,fire,"Just as sitting before a fire enlivens the imagination and lets you see almost anything you want to in the flames, this kanji is so simple it lets you see almost any sort of fire you want to see. It no longer makes a good pictograph, but I invite you to take a pencil and paper and play with the form—first writing it as shown below and then adding lines here and there—to see what you can come up with. Everything from matchbooks to cigarette lighters to volcanic eruptions to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah have been found here. No doubt you, too, will find something interesting to bend your memory around these four simple strokes. [4]",4,カ
火,1,火②,火,fire,"* To avoid confusion later on, it is best to keep to the meaning of a fireplace (or hearth) or a raging conflagration like a forest fire for this kanji’s primitive meaning. Another primitive element for fire, based on this one, is written ½ and will mean flames, cauldron, cooking fire, or an oven fire.",,カ
火,2,煩②,煩,"anxiety, trouble, worry, pain, ill, annoy, nuisance, irksome","The existential condition of anxiety that arises from the inevitable frustration of our worldly passions is contained in this character.

火,3,灯,灯,"lamp, a light, light, counter for lights","Since it is very hard to read by the fireplace without going blind from the flickering of the flames or burning up from the heat, our ancestors invented a way to nail down a bit of that fire, just enough to light up the text of their evening newspapers and no more. Voilà! The lamp. [6]",6,トウ
火,4,畑,畑,"farm, field, garden, one's specialty, (kokuji)","Looking at the primitives, a fireplace and a rice field, we find the essential ingredients for a farm: a warm hearth to sit by at night, and a well-ploughed field to grow one’s crops in by day. [9]",9,
火,5,燃,燃,"burn, blaze, glow","Hearth . . . sort of thing. Beware of letting the simple reading off of the primitive elements do your work for you. Unless you make a vivid image of something burning and relate it just as vividly to those primitive meanings, you can count on forgetting this character very quickly. [16]",16,ネン
火,6,災,災,"disaster, calamity, woe, curse, evil","Of all of nature’s disasters, this kanji picks out two of the worst: floods and fires. To recall the disposition of the elements, think of nature’s solution to nature’s own problem: a great flood pouring down over a great forest fire. [7]",7,サイ
火,7,灰,灰,"ashes, puckery juice, cremate","The kanji for ashes naturally includes the primitive for fire, or more specifically, a fireplace. Now what do you do with that bucket of ashes you have just cleaned out of the fireplace? You walk to the edge of a cliff and tip it upside down, watching as they are swept away in the wind like a swarm of gray mosquitoes. Thus the fire, once it has turned to ashes, ends up at the bottom of the cliff. [6]",6,カイ
火,8,炎,炎,"inflammation, flame, blaze","A fire belongs in the hearth, not over it. When the fire spreads to the rest of the house, we have an inflamed house.

[8]",8,エン
火,9,淡,淡,"thin, faint, pale, fleeting","The primitives in this kanji read: water . . . inflammation. Taking inflammation in its medical sense, the first water-related inflammation that pops into mind is dehydration, the principal symptom of which is that it makes one shrivel up and look very, very thin. If that is hard to remember, try thinking it backwards: a very thin chap passes by and you imagine him suffering from (being inflamed with) dehydration (hence the element for water). [11]",11,タン

Although nobody ever thought of such a thing before—as least as far as I know, they didn’t—imagine using those spots as a technique for fortune-telling. The old witch sits before her cauldron and watches the spots that show up when she turns to look at you, and from that tells your fortune. [9]",9,テン
⺣,3,照,照,"illuminate, shine, compare, bashful","Although the range of possible meanings that the kanji for illuminate can have is about as rich as the connotations of the English word, we need to focus on just one of them: to make something shine. If you glaze a pot and put it into the oven to fire it, you in fact illuminate it. Hence the kanji for illuminate compares the kanji for shining with the primitive element for the oven’s fire. [13]",13,ショウ
魚,1,魚①,魚,fish,"The composition of this kanji shows three elements, which we list in the order of their writing: bound up . . . rice field . . . cooking fire. We can join them together by thinking of a three-part story: first a fish is caught and bound up on a line with its unfortunate school-mates; when the fisherman gets home, he cuts off the head and tosses it, with the entrails, out into the rice fields for fertilizer; and the rest he sets in a skillet over a cooking fire for his supper.

木,1,木①,木,"tree, wood","* as a primitive, this kanji can be used to mean tree or wood. In those cases where the last two strokes are detached from the trunk (6), we shall change its meaning to pole, or wooden pole.",,ボク、モク
木,1,木②,木,"tree, wood","Here we see a pictograph of a tree, showing the main trunk in the long vertical stroke and the boughs in the long horizontal stroke. The final two strokes sweep down in both directions to indicate the roots. Although it may look similar at first sight to the kanji for water (frame 130), the order in which it is written is completely different and this affects its final appearance. [4]",4,ボク、モク
木,3,林,林,"grove, forest",Learn this frame in connection with the next one. A grove is a small cluster of trees. Hence the simple reduplication of the kanji for tree gives us the grove. [8],8,リン

木,5,植,植,plant,You have no doubt seen how people practicing the Japanese art of bonsai take those helpless little saplings and twist them into crippled dwarves before they have a chance to grow up as they should. The more proper way to plant a young tree and give it a fair shake in life is to set it into the earth in such a way that it can grow up straight. [12],12,ショク
木,6,村,村,"village, town","The character for village was associated with rice fields (frame 92). That for town, a step up on the evolutionary path to cities, shows a circle of trees glued together to measure off the confines of a town. [7]",7,ソン
木,7,本,本,"book, present, main, origin, true, real, counter for long cylindrical things","Recalling that books are made of paper, and paper made of trees, one might think of a book as a slice of a tree.

木,8,案,案,"plan, suggestion, draft, ponder, fear, proposition, idea, expectation, worry, table, bench","Without much effort, the elements relax . . . tree suggest a hammock strung between two trees in your backyard, and you stretched out in it, hands folded behind your head, planning something or other. After all, it’s something we all do from time to time: kick up our legs on the nearest piece of furniture and daydream about the best plan of action to take. Only here be sure to relate the relaxation to the tree, so that you don’t end up with something else in its place (like “legs” or “desk” or “table”). [10]",10,アン
木,9,桂,桂,"Japanese Judas-tree, cinnamon tree","Unless you are a botanist, you are not likely to know what a Japanese Judas-tree looks like, and probably never even heard of it before, but the name is sufficiently odd to make remembering it easy. Using the primitives as our guide, we define it as a tree with ivy growing down its branches in the shape of a hangman’s rope. [10]",10,ケイ
木,10,柏,柏,"oak, cypress","This kanji calls to mind the famous myth of the “golden bough.” As you may recall, what made the sacred oak in the forest of Diana the Huntress outside of Rome “golden” were the white berries of the mistletoe that grew in the branches of the tree, presumably appearing yellow when the light of the sun shone through them. (If you don’t know the story, take a break today and hunt it down in a dictionary of myth and fable. Even if you forget the kanji, which of course you won’t, the story of the mistletoe and the fate it brought to Balder the Beautiful is most memorable.) [9]",9,
木,11,枠,枠,"frame, framework, spindle, spool, bounding-box, (kokuji)","You might think of the frame this character refers to as the sort of frame we have created by drawing a dark line around this kanji and its explanation. Then think of that line as made of very thin wood; and finally note how each time the line bends it forms a 90° angle, thus giving us the nine and the ten. [8]",8,
木,12,棚,棚,"shelf, ledge, rack, mount, mantle, trellis","One often thinks of books as “good companions,” but here it is the shelf we store them on that is the companion. The reasons should be obvious: it is made of the same stuff, wood, and spends a lot more time with them than we do! Here again, be careful not to let the rationality of the explanation get in the way before you turn it into a proper story. [12]",12,ホウ
木,13,杏,杏,apricot,"Since apricots can be eaten just as they fall from the trees, picture this mouth agape at the bottom of a tree (just as the elements have it), waiting for apricots to fall into it. [7]",7,
木,14,桐,桐,paulownia,"Since you probably don’t know what a paulownia tree is, we shall let the key word suggest the phrase “the Little Brothers of St. Paulownia” and it is a short step to associate the tree with the monks to its right. (For the curious, the name of this oriental tree really comes from a Russian princess, Anna Pavlovna.) [10]",10,
木,15,枯,枯,"wither, die, dry up, be seasoned","What makes a tree begin to wither up, and perhaps even die, is a kind of arteriosclerosis that keeps its sap from flowing freely. Usually this is due to simple old age, as this character shows us. Be sure to picture a wrinkled old tree, withering away in a retirement Centre so that the commonsense explanation does not take over. [9]",9,コ
木,16,朴,朴,"crude, simple, plain, docile","As all magicians who have passed their apprenticeship know, one makes one’s wand out of a hazel branch and is careful not to alter the natural form of the wood. For the magic of the wand derives its power from its association with the hidden laws of nature, and needs therefore to be kept in its crude, natural state. [6]",6,ボク
木,17,相,相,"inter-, mutual, together, each other, minister of state, councillor, aspect, phase, physiognomy","he prefix interstirs up associations of cooperation among people. From there we read off the elements: tree . . . eye. Those two words call to mind the scriptural proverb about first taking the tree out of one’s own eye before helping your neighbours with the splinter in theirs. What more useful rule for interhuman relationships, and what more useful tool for remembering this kanji! [9]",9,ソウ、ショウ
木,18,机,机,"desk, table","We need to fix imagination here on two things to learn the kanji for desk: the wonderful rough wood of which it has been hewn and the wind that blows across it, sending your papers flying all over the room. These two elements, written in that order, dictate how to write the character. [6]",6,キ

未,1,未①,未,"un-, not yet, hitherto, still, even now, sign of the ram, 1-3PM, eighth sign of Chinese zodiac","As the key word suggests, this kanji has to do with something not quite over and done with. More concretely, it shows us a tree that is not yet fully grown. The extra short stroke in the upper branches shows new branches spreading out, leaving one with the feeling that the tree has a ways to go yet before it reaches maturity. In other words, the kanji conveys its meaning pictographically, playing on the earlier pictograph of the tree. [5]",5,ミ、ビ
未,2,味,味,"flavor, taste","When a tree has not yet finished growing, it produces fruit with a full flavor. When the official taster (the professional mouth to the left) determines that full flavor has been reached, the tree is pruned back so that it remains permanently not yet grown. A neat little agricultural trick and an easy to way see the sense of flavor hidden in this character. [8]",8,ミ

未,5,朱,朱,"vermilion, cinnabar, scarlet, red, bloody","That red-orange colour we call vermilion is found in nature during the fall when the leaves lose their sugar and begin to change colour. This kanji depicts the very last leaf on a tree in the fall (the drop hung in the first stroke), the leaf that has not yet fallen as it one day must. Look at its colour—vermilion. (Well, not really. The truth is, vermilion is made from a mercuric sulfide, but I’m sure you will agree that autumn leaves are a lot easier to work with.) [6]",6,シュ
未,6,株,株,"stocks, stump, shares, stock, counter for small plants","The stocks bought and sold on the market by the tens of millions each day get their name from a comparison to a healthy tree, in which one takes “stock” in the hopes that it will grow and produce more and more trees like itself. Usually good stocks are referred to as “blue chip,” but here we are asked to associate the key word with the colour vermilion, perhaps because one can assess the value of a tree from the colour of its autumn leaves.

末,1,末①,末,"end, close, tip, powder, posterity","previous frame. The first stroke shows a branch that is longer than the main branch, indicating that the tree has reached the extremity of its growth, so that its branches stop spreading and start drooping downwards. Be sure to keep this imagery in mind, to avoid confusing this key word with synonyms that will appear later. [5]",5,マツ、バツ
末,2,沫,沫,"splash, suds","The splash this kanji refers to is the dash of water against the rocks, with all the foam and spray that this creates. If you think of a splash in this sense as a wave that has run its full course and reached its extremity, namely the seashore, and if you think of it pictorially in your mind’s eye, this somewhat rare (but ohsoeasy-to-learn) kanji is yours for good.

(This meaning accords well with Japan, where the output of rice far exceeds that of wheat.) It occasionally takes the shape j when it stands on its own, or is joined to a line above. In this case, we shall have it refer specifically to grains of rice. This primitive is not to be confused with the similar-looking primitive for water. While the stroke orders are nearly alike, grains of rice has 5 strokes, while water only has 4 because it joins the second and third strokes into one. Finally, we may note that by itself the kanji for rice is an abbreviation used for the United States, which can then also serve as an alternate reading for the main primitive form, if you so wish.",,ベイ、マイ、メエトル

Think of reading turtle shells as a way to foretell the future, and in particular things that portend coming evils. [6]",6,チョウ
兆,1,兆②,兆,portent,"* When this character is used as a primitive in its full form, we keep the key-word sense of a portent. When it appears to the left in its abbreviated form (namely, the left half only, 7), we shall give it the pictographic sense of a turtle. 1",,チョウ
兆,2,桃,桃,peach,"To associate the peach tree with the primitive for a portent, recall the famous Japanese legend of Momotarõ, the Peach Boy. It begins once upon a time with a fisherman and his wife who wanted badly to have a child, but none was born to them. Then one day the old man caught a giant peach, out of which jumped a healthy young lad whom they named Peach Boy. Though the boy was destined to perform heroic deeds, his birth also portended great misfortune (how else could he become a hero?). Thus the tree that is associated with a portent of coming evil comes to be the peach tree. [10]",10,トウ

牛,2,特,特,special,"Despite the strong phonetic similarity, there will be no problem keeping the key word special distinct from the character we met earlier for specialty (frame 46), since the latter has immediate connotations lacking in this kanji. Anyway, let special refer to something in a special class all its own—like the sacred cows of India that wander freely without fear of being butchered and ground into hamburger. Though the practice is a Hindu one, the Buddha’s refusal to take the life of any sentient being makes it only fitting that the cows should be placed on the sacred grounds of a Buddhist temple in this kanji.

牛,4,先,先,"before, ahead, previous, future, precedence","Take this key word in its physical, not its temporal, sense (even though it refers to both).

The first stroke shows the head thrown back; the second, the arm bent at the elbow as the hand reaches up to cover the mouth; and the last two, the legs.

艹,2,若,若,"young, if, perhaps, possibly, low number, immature","Here we see a flower held in the right hand.

As the grass begins to turn green again after winter has passed, these tiny flowers dot up here and there.

艹,5,苦,苦,"suffering, trial, worry, hardship, feel bitter, scowl","The picture of suffering we are given here is that of a flower that has grown old. When a flower ages, it pales and dries up, and probably even suffers. If you think that plants are incapable of such feelings, then ask yourself why so many people believe that talking to their flowers helps them bloom better. [8]",8,ク
艹,6,薄,薄,"dilute, thin, weak (tea), pampas grass","Take a good look at this kanji: the “strong” element here is really the flower, not the water as you might have thought on first glance. To the right is the acupuncturist from frame 47. Taking the key word to connote diluting the vital humours of the body, we can imagine our acupuncturist performing his task with flowers in place of needles, and using their hollow stems to pipe water into the body of the patient.

艹,7,葉,葉,"leaf, plane, lobe, needle, blade, spear, counter for flat things, fragment, piece","Three elements are given here: flower . . . generation . . . tree. The first and last seem logical enough, since it is the leaf that feeds the flowers on a tree.

莫,1,莫①,莫,graveyard,"* graveyard, The element shown here should be taken to represent a modern graveyard. Gone are the cobwebs and gnarled trees, the tilted headstones and dark, moonless nights that used to scare the wits out of our childhood imaginations. Instead, we see brightly coloured flowers placed before the tombstones, the sun shining gloriously overhead, and a cuddly St. Bernard sitting at the gate keeping watch. [10]",10,
莫,2,模,模,"imitation, copy, mock","Ah, but haven’t modern graveyards become a parody of their ancestors! The flowers are plastic, the writing on the stones is unimaginative and cold, and the whole thing looks more like a marble orchard than a right and proper graveyard. This kanji continues with the modernization trend by picturing imitation trees in the graveyard. But of course, how convenient! They don’t need pruning or fertilizing, their leaves don’t fall, and they remain the same colour all year long. [14]",14,モ、ボ
莫,3,漠,漠,"vague, obscure, desert, wide","Think of the key word as having to do with something viewed through a haze, or in the twilight and from a distance, so that only its outlines are vaguely discernible. Now we are back again to the essence of the true graveyard. The water may be taken as the sound of waves dashing up against the rocks or the dripping of moisture on cold rock—anything that helps you associate vagueness with the graveyard and keep it distinct from the imitation we met in the last frame.

莫,4,膜,膜,membrane,"The part of the body first affected by a stroll through a haunted graveyard is the skin, which gets goose bumps. But we save the word “skin” for another kanji, and use the odd word “membrane” here.

莫,5,藻,藻,"seaweed, duckweed",[19],19,ソウ
莫,6,墓,墓,"grave, tomb","The mounds of soil with crude wooden crosses set at their head suggests those boot-hill graves we all know from cowboy lore. The only odd thing about this kanji is that the soil comes under the graveyard, rather than to its left, where we might expect. Just think of the bodies as “lying under boot-hill” if you have any trouble. By the way, this is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that we learn a kanji whose key word is the same, or almost the same, as a primitive element based on it, but whose shape differs somewhat. There is no cause to worry. By using the primitive in a variety of other characters, as we have done here, the confusion will be averted as a matter of course. [13]",13,ボ
