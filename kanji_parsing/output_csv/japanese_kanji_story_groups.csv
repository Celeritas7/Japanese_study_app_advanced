1,一,One,"* as a primitive ELEMENT, the key-word meaning is discarded, and the single horizontal stroke takes on the meaning of floor or ceiling, depending on its position: if it stands above another primitive, it means ceiling; if below, floor.",イチ、イツ
2,匕,,,
3,七,seven,"This character, a pictograph of a spoon, is easy enough to remember, provided you keep it distinct from that for seven. The difference, of course, is that the first stroke cuts across the second only ever so slightly here. [2]",シチ
4,旨,"delicious, relish, show a liking for, purport, will, clever, expert",Something is so downright delicious that one spends the entire day with a spoon in hand gobbling it up. [6],シ
5,眞,"truth, reality, Buddhist sect",Someone sitting on the ground . . . straightaway . . . animal legs. [10],
6,比,"compare, race, ratio, Philippines","With two spoons, one in each hand, you are comparing your mother’s cooking with your mother-in-law’s. [4]",ヒ
7,昆,"descendants, elder brother, insect","By comparing apes with anthropoids, we not only discover the latter have descended from those progenitors educated in the higher branches, but that the very idea of seeing everything descended from everything else, one way or another, means that there is “nothing new under the sun.” [8]",コン
8,皆,"all, everything","Think of the housewives in tv commercials “comparing the whiteness” of their laundry across the fence, a typical advertisement for the popular detergent known as all. (If you don’t know the brand, surely you’ve heard the phrases “all-purpose detergent” or “all-temperature detergent.”) [9]",カイ
9,疑,"doubt, distrust, be suspicious, question",Spoon . . . dart . . . chop-seal . . . zoo. [14],ギ
10,九,baseball team or simply baseball,"* as a primitive, we shall use this kanji to mean baseball team or simply baseball. The meaning, of course, is derived from the nine players who make up a team.",キュウ、ク
12,十,ten,"* as a primitive, this character sometimes keeps its meaning of ten and sometimes signifies needle, this latter derived from the kanji for needle [(frame 274). Since the primitive is used in the kanji itself, there is no need to worry about confusing the two. In fact, we shall be following this procedure regularly.",
13,廿,,,
14,,"commoner, all, bastard",Caverns . . . oven fire. [11],ショ
15,度,"degrees, occurrence, time, counter for occurrences, consider, attitude","This key word refers to a gradation of measurement, not to academic diplomas. Its primitives: caverns . . . crotch. [9]",ド、ト、タク
16,世,,,
17,千,thousand,"This kanji is almost too simple to pull apart, but for the sake of practice, have a look at the drop above and the ten below. Now put the elements together by thinking of squeezing two more zeros out of an eyedropper alongside the number ten to make it a thousand. [3]",セン
19,中,"in, inside, middle, mean, Centre","The elements here are a walking stick and a mouth. Remember the trouble your mother had getting medicine in your mouth? Chances are it crossed her mind more than once to grab something handy, like your grandfather’s walking stick, to pry open your jaws while she performed her duty. Keep the image of getting something in from the outside, and the otherwise abstract sense of this key word should be a lot easier than trying to spoon castor oil into a baby’s mouth. [4]",チュウ
20,𠀐,,,
21,貴,"precious, value, prize, esteem, honor",Purse . . . shells. [12],キ
22,丩,cornucopia,"* cornucopia ¥ Considering the lack of circular lines, this kanji is not a bad pictograph of a cornucopia. Despite the appearance of the printed form, what looks like the first two strokes are actually written as one. [2]",
23,卑,"lowly, base, vile, vulgar",A drop of . . . brains . . . cornucopia. [8],ヒ
24,丶,a drop of,"* In general, it is written from right to left, but there are times when it can be slanted left to right. At other times it can be stretched out a bit. (In cases where you have trouble remembering this, it may help to think of it as an eyedropper dripping drops of something or other.) Examples will follow in this Lesson.",
25,日,sun or day or a tongue wagging in the mouth,"* Used as a primitive, this kanji can mean sun or day or a tongue wagging in the mouth. This latter meaning, incidentally, derives from an old character outside the standard list meaning something like “sayeth” and written almost exactly the same, except that the stroke in the middle does not touch the right side (Q, frame 578).",ニチ、ジツ
26,假,"temporary, interim, assumed (name), informal",,
27,白,white bird or dove,"* as a primitive, this character can either retain its meaning of white or take the more graphic meaning of a white bird or dove. This latter stems from the fact that it appears at the top of the kanji for bird, which we shall get to later (frame 1941).",ハク、ビャク
28,皃,"countenance, appearance",White . . . Human legs.,
29,,"crevice, fissure, discord, opportunity, leisure",Pinnacle . . . little . . . spring. [13],ゲキ、 キャク、 ケキ
30,原,"meadow, original, PRIMITIVE, field, plain, prairie, tundra, wilderness","Though the kanji is broad enough to embrace both meanings, the meadow you should imagine here is not a flatland plain but a mountain meadow in the Austrian Alps. (Perhaps the opening scene of “The Sound of Music” will help.) Simply think of little springs bubbling up across the meadow to form a sort of path that leads you right to the brink of a precipitous cliff. Now if you can see Schwester Maria skipping along merrily, dodging in and out of the springs, and then falling headlong over the cliff, you have a ridiculous story that should help fix this kanji in memory. [10]",
31,泉,"spring, fountain",White . . . water. [13],セン
32,自,nose or nostrils,"* The same meaning of oneself can be kept when this kanji is used as a primitive ELEMENT, but you will generally find it better to give it the meaning of nose or nostrils, both because it accords with the story above and because it is the first part of the kanji for nose (frame 678).",ジ、シ
33,旦,"daybreak, dawn, morning","While we normally refer to the start of the day as “daybreak,” Japanese commonly refers to it as the “opening up of night” into day. Hence the choice of this rather odd key word, nightbreak. The single stroke at the bottom represents the floor (have a peek again at frame 1) or the horizon over which the sun is poking its head. [5]",タン、 ダン
34,亘,"span, range, extend over","“Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset…” goes the song of the Fiddler on the Roof. You can almost see the journey of the sun as it moves from one horizon (the floor) to its noonday heights in the sky overhead (ceiling) and then disappears over the other horizon—day after day, marking the span of our lives. [6]",
35,早,,,
36,𠦝,mist,"* mist $ Here is our second example of a primitive composed of other primitives but not itself a kanji. At the bottom is the primitive (also a kanji) for early or sunflower. At the top, a needle. Conveniently, mist falls early in the morning, like little needles of rain, to assure that the sunflower blooms early as we have learned it should. [8]",
38,月,"moon, flesh, or part of the body","*AS A primitive ELEMENT, this character can take on the sense of moon, flesh, or part of the body. The reasons for the latter two meanings will be explained in a later chapter.",
40,肖,"spark, candle","* When used as a primitive, the sense of resemblance is replaced by that of spark or candle. (If you want an explanation: the kanji for moon also carries a secondary sense of fire, which we omitted because we are keeping that meaning for other primitives.)",
41,用,"a screwdriver, perhaps the most utilized of all tools around the house.","* as a primitive ELEMENT, we shall substitute the image of a screwdriver, perhaps the most utilized of all tools around the house.",ヨウ
42,角,the tool used by draftsmen and carpenters to draw right-angles,"* as a primitive, imagine the tool used by draftsmen and carpenters to draw right-angles.",カク
43,身,"somebody, person, one's station in life","The key word somebody was chosen to convey the double meaning of this kanji: body and person. Its composition is based on the nose (which, you will recall, is also the kanji for oneself). The extension of the bottom and far right strokes of that element, together with the unusual diagonal stroke, forms the pictograph of somebody with a prominent paunch. [7]",シン
44,瓦,"tile, gram","Ceiling . . . walking stick . . . fishhook . . . ice. Note how the last stroke of the final element, ice, is stretched out to close the bottom of the tile. [5]",ガ
45,夜,"night, evening","First of all, be sure not to confuse the connotations of night with those of evening (frame 109) and night break (frame 30). Its elements: top hat . . person . . .walking legs . . . drop. [8]",ヤ
46,彑,pig's head radical variant (no. 58),pig's head,
47,,"by means of, because, in view of, compared with","Picture a person dragging a plow behind, and the drop of sweat which falls from his brow as he does his work. Think of him (or her, for that matter) making a living “by means of the sweat of their brows.” [5]",イ
48,凹,"concave, hollow, sunken","You couldn’t have asked for a better key word for this kanji! Just have a look at it: a perfect image of a concave lens (remembering, of course, that the kanji square off rounded things), complete with its own little “cave.” Now all you have to do is learn how to write it. [5]",オウ
49,丷,horns,"* horns ( This primitive element always appears at the top of the element to which it is related, and is always attached, or almost attached, to the first horizontal line to come under it. The horns can never simply be left hanging in the air. When there is no line available, an extra horizontal stroke (like a one) is added. The final kanji of this Lesson gives an example. The meaning of this element is wide enough to embrace the horns of bulls, rams, billy goats, and moose, but not the family of musical instruments. As with other elements with such “open” meanings, it is best to settle on one that you find most vivid and stick with that image consistently. [2]",
50,前,"in front, before","We waited to introduce this character until now, even though the pieces have been available for some time, because it helps to reinforce the odd kanji of the last frame. Picture the butcher hacking away with his knife at a slab of meat on his table with a pair of ram’s horns placed in front of him (or on his head, if you prefer). There is no need to worry about confusing this kanji with that for before (frame 248), since it will not appear as a primitive in any other character used in this book. [9]",ゼン
51,兌,devil,* devil P The two horns on the head of the teenager are enough to suggest to most parents of adolescents a good image of a devil. [7],
52,曽,increase,"* The primitive meaning, increase, comes from the next frame. Always think of something multiplying wildly as you watch.",ソウ、ソ、ゾウ
53,兼,"concurrently, and, beforehand, in advance","At the top we have the animal horns and the single horizontal stroke to give them something to hang onto. Below that, we see one rake with two handles. Finally, we see a pair of strokes splitting away from each of the handles, indicating that they are both splitting under the pressure. The composite picture is of someone holding down two jobs concurrently, using the same kit of tools to move in two different directions and ending up in a mess. Take the time to find this sense in the kanji and it will be easy to remember, despite initial appearances. [10]",ケン
54,乙,fishhook,"* We will keep fishhook as the primitive meaning. Its shape will rarely be quite the same as that of the kanji. When it appears at the bottom of another primitive, it is straightened out, almost as if the weight of the upper element had bent it out of shape. And when it appears to the right of another element, the short horizontal line that gets the shape started is omitted and it is stretched out and narrowed, all for reasons of space and aesthetics. Examples of these alterations (which are consistent) follow.",オツ、 イツ
55,丁,"street, nail, spike","* Used as a primitive, we change the meaning of the key word and take the shape to signify a nail or a spike. Should it happen, on reviewing, that you find the pictographs get jumbled, then think of jerking a street sign out of the ground and using it as a nail to repair your garage roof.",チョウ、テイ、チン、トウ、チ
56,可,"can, passable, mustn't, should not, do not","when you hear this key word, and the rest is simple. See the determined little locomotive huffing and puffing up the mountain—” I think I can, I think I can....”—spitting railroad spikes out of its mouth as it chews up the line to the top. [5]",カ、コク
57,年,"year, counter for years","In an odd fashion, the kanji for year joins together the element for horse, on the top, and the right half of the element for sunglasses. Think of it as a horse wearing sunglasses with one of the lenses popped out. We will use this latter image again, so learn it now and save yourself the trouble later. [6]",ネン
58,韋,tanned leather radical (no. 178),"* locket y The vertical stroke added here (the third stroke) turns the primitive element for a key into a locket. Below that, we find a square container (the mouth) and sunglasses with one of the lenses popped out. Note that in the primitive element for locket the final vertical stroke of sunglasses reaches all the way through to touch the mouth. [10]",
59,田,,,
60,畐,wealth,"* wealth & To prepare for following frame, we introduce here a somewhat rare primitive meaning wealth. It takes its meaning from the common image of the overwealthy as overfed. More specifically, the kanji shows us one single mouth devouring all the harvest of the fields, presumably while those who labour in them go hungry. Think of the phrase exactly as it is written when you draw the character, and the disposition of the elements is easy. [9]",
61,鬲,"""tripod"" radical, Chinese kettle with three legs",Ceiling . . . mouth . . . glass canopy . . . human legs . . . spike. You might want to compare the kanji with tripod,
62,由,"shoot, sprout","* as a primitive, in conformity to the explanation above, this kanji will be taken to mean shoot or sprout.",ユ、ユウ、ユイ
63,甲,"roots, Important to that word is the image of “pushing downwards,” as roots do.","ô õ * The primitive meaning is roots. Important to that word is the image of “pushing downwards,” as roots do.",コウ、 カン
64,申,(seed) monkey,"ö ÷ * While this kanji has obvious affinities to the “seed” group, it also happens to be the zodiacal sign of the monkey (the one who speaketh no evil, among other things). We shall therefore take monkey as its primitive meaning.",シン
65,果,"fruit, reward, carry out, achieve, complete, end, finish, succeed","The final stage of the seed is reached when the plant has reached its full growth (the tree) and comes to fruition, producing fruit full of new seeds that can return to the earth and start the process all over again. The main thing to notice here is the element for brains at the top, which might prove more helpful than rice field for creating an image. [8]",カ

67,鬼,"ghost, devil",Drop of . . . brains . . . human legs . . . elbow. [10],キ
68,曲,,,
69,曹,"office, official, comrade, fellow",This character is written in the order of its elements: one . . . bend . . . sun. [11],ソウ、ゾウ
70,里,"logic, computer","* To get a more concrete primitive meaning for this kanji, we shall refer to it as a computer, a meaning deriving from the kanji for logic, which we will meet in Lesson 12.",
71,黒,black,"Like most things electrical, a computer, too, can overheat. Just imagine flames pouring out of it and charring the keyboard, the monitor, and your desk a sooty black colour. [11]",コク

75,巴,mosaic,"* mosaic ú This element is shaped roughly like the snake, but pay attention to the difference when writing it. [4]",ハ
76,色,colour,Bound up . . . mosaic. [6],ショク、シキ
77,赤,"red, apple","* as a primitive on the left, this kanji keeps the same form.

Elsewhere, the first two strokes are abbreviated to a single dot, giving us 8. This latter form will take the meaning of an apple. 4",セキ、シャク
78,黄,yellow,Salad . . . sprout . . . animal legs. [11],コウ、オウ
79,目,eye,"* as a primitive, the kanji keeps its sense of eye, or more specifically, an eyeball. In the surroundings of a complex kanji, the primitive will sometimes be turned on its side like this: {.",モク、ボク
80,口,mouth,"* as a primitive, this form also means mouth. Any of the range of possible images that the word suggests—an opening or entrance to a cave, a river, a bottle, or even the largest hole in your head—can be used for the primitive meaning.",コウ、ク
81,吾,"risk, face, defy, dare, damage, assume (a name)","There are actually a number of kanji for the word I, but the others tend to be more specific than this one. The key word here should be taken in the general psychological sense of the “perceiving subject.” Now the one place in our bodies that all five senses are concentrated in is the head, which has no less than five mouths: 2 nostrils, 2 ears, and 1 mouth. Hence, five mouths = I. [7]",
82,呆,,,
83,懆,,,
84,嵒,,,
86,言,"saying, speech, words","* This kanji, which appears often as a primitive, can mean saying, speech, or words, depending on which is most useful.",ゲン、ゴン
87,呂,"spine, backbone",This character is rather like a picture of two of the vertebrae in the spine linked by a single stroke. [7],ロ、 リョ
88,𠂤,maestro,"* maestro … To go with this primitive meaning, you might picture a tuxedo-clad maestro waving his baton about wildly. The baton is seen in the drop at the top. And the two boxes attached to the long vertical stroke may represent his tuxedo tails, if you wish. [6]",
89,官,"bureaucrat, the government, organ","By replacing the maestro’s baton (the drop) with the roof of a house, we have his equivalent in the institutional world of big government: the bureaucrat. [8]",カン
90,串,"spit, skewer","##  This pictograph of two pieces of meat on a skewer, a shish kebab, will help us in the next frame. [7]",カン、 ケン、 セン
91,リ,"squad, corps, unit, group",Spear . . . two balls. [10],ハン
92,刀,dagger,"* In the form of the kanji, this primitive means a dagger. When it appears to the right of another element, it is commonly stretched out like this § and takes the sense of a great and flashing sabre, a meaning it gets from a character we shall learn later (frame 1671).",トウ
93,刃,"blade, sword, edge","Think of using a dagger as a razor blade, and it shouldn’t be hard to imagine cutting yourself. See the little drop of blood clinging to the blade? [3]",
94,召,"seduce, call, send for, wear, put on, ride in, buy, eat, drink, catch (cold)",A sword or dagger posed over a mouth is how the character for “beckoning” is written. The related but less tame key word seduce was chosen because it seemed to fit better with the— how shall we put it?—Freudian implications of the kanji. (Observe if you will that it is not sure whether the long slender object is seducing the small round one or vice versa.) [5],ショウ
95,寸,glue or glued to,"* as a primitive, we shall use this to mean glue or glued to. There is no need to devise a story to remember this, since the primitive will appear so often you would have to struggle hard not to remember it.",スン
96,専,acupuncturist,* The primitive form of this kanji eliminates the needle on the left and gets the meaning of an acupuncturist.,セン
97,專,,,
98,斗,measuring cup,"* Since we already have a primitive element for a “dipper”— namely, the ladle—we shall let this one stand for a measuring cup. By the way, it would make a rather large one, since the kanji is also used for a measure of about 18 liters!",ト、トウ
99,甫,dog tag,"* dog tag ¡ This primitive refers to all sorts of identification tags, but dog tag is chosen for its descriptiveness. On the top we see the arrowhead, joined to the screwdriver below by the lengthened vertical stroke. [7]",
100,卜,"divining rod, magic wand","* divining rod í This is a picture of a divining rod, composed of a drop and a walking stick, but easy enough to remember as a pictograph. Alternately, you can think of it as a magic wand. In either case, it should suggest images of magic or fortune-telling. Nowadays it is written in the stroke order given here when it appears as a primitive, but until recently the order was often reversed (in order to instill correct habits for more stylized calligraphy). [2]

* Although it falls outside of the list of general-use kanji, this element is actually a kanji in its own right, having virtually the same meaning as the kanji in the next frame.",
101,占,"fortune-telling, divining, forecasting, occupy, hold, have, get, take","This is one of those kanji that is a real joy of simplicity: a divining rod with a mouth—which translate directly into fortunetelling. Note how the movement from top to bottom (the movement in which the kanji are written) is also the order of the elements which make up our story and of the key word itself: first divining rod, then mouth. This will not always be possible, but where it is, memory has almost no work at all to do. [5]",セン
102,立,"stand up, vase","* Used as a primitive, it can also mean vase. In taking its kanji meaning, it is best to think of something standing up that is normally lying down, or something standing up in an unusual way. 1",リツ、リュウ、リットル
103,咅,muzzle,"* muzzle N The element for muzzle shows a vase fixed over a mouth, perhaps with a rubber band running around the back of the head to keep it in place. [8]",
104,妾,concubine,a woman who lives with a man but has lower status than his wife or wives [8],
105,章,"badge, chapter, composition, poem, design",,ショウ
106,音,sound,* The primitive from this kanji also means simply a sound.,オン、イン、-ノン
107,戠,"a fiesta, namely a kazoo.","* kazoo O This primitive’s special usefulness lies not in its frequency but in its simplification of a few otherwise difficult kanjis. It pictures the sound of a fiesta, namely a kazoo. Note how the element for sound is written first, the fifth stroke extended so that it can be used in the element for fiesta. [12]",
108,竟,mirror,"* mirror ‚ This primitive gets its meaning from the following frame. It shows a pair of human legs and a tongue-wagging mouth looking at a mirror standing on the wall, asking perhaps who might be the fairest of them all. [11]",
109,意,"idea, mind, heart, taste, thought, desire, care, liking",Sound . . . heart. [13],イ

113,啇,antique,"* antique Ð The primitive meaning antique, not itself a kanji, depicts a vase kept under a glass hood because it is very, very old. [11]",
114,辛,"spicy, red pepper","* as a primitive, we shall use this meaning of spicy

except when the two extra strokes are added to the bottom, giving it the form of a tree: ¹. Then we take its alternate meaning of a red pepper plant. The connection is obvious.",シン
115,辟,ketchup,"* ketchup ÷ One way American children learn to cope with food they are forced to eat against their will is to smother it with ketchup. We can see this depicted in the mouth with the flag over it (in this case, the Stars and Stripes), set alongside the element for spicy (all of which is not far removed from the original meaning it had as a character on its own: “false”).

121,,"only, free, in addition","When we run across abstract key words like this one, the best way to get an image it to recall some common but suggestive phrase in which the word appears. For instance, we can think of the expression “it’s the only one of its kind.” Then we imagine a barker at a side-show advertising some strange pac-man like creature he has inside his tent, with only a gigantic mouth and two wee animal legs. [5]",シ
122,貝,"shells, oyster and clam","* When used as a primitive, in addition to shells, the meanings oyster and clam will often come in handy.",バイ
123,貢,"tribute, support, finance",A tribute has a kind of double-meaning in English: honor paid freely and money collected by coercion. Simply because a ruler bestows a noble name on a deed is hardly any consolation to the masses who must part with their hard-earned money. Little wonder that this ancient craft of getting money by calling it a tribute has given way to a name closer to how it feels to those who pay it: a tax. [10],コウ、 ク
124,頁,head,"* as a primitive, this kanji takes the unrelated meaning of a head (preferably one detached from its body), derived from the character for head (frame 1441).",
125,,"tool, utensil, means, possess, ingredients, counter for armor, suits, sets of furniture","Here is the full kanji on which the last frame is based. If you can think of a table full of carpenter’s tools of all sorts, each equipped with its own eye so that it can keep a watch over what you are doing with it, you won’t have trouble later keeping the primitive and the kanji apart.

127,呉,"give, do something for, kingdom of Wu","The complex of strokes in this kanji is unusual and difficult, because of the fourth stroke, which is rare (see frames 33 and 34). The mouth and tool are already familiar. [7]",ゴ
128,儿,human legs,"* human legs # Notice how these human legs are somewhat shapelier and more highly evolved than those of the so-called “lower animals.” The one on the left, drawn first, is straight; while the one on the right bends gracefully and ends with a hook. Though they are not likely to suggest the legs of any human you know, they do have something of the look of someone out for a stroll, especially if you compare them to animal legs. If you had any trouble with the kanji for the number four, now would be the time to return to it (frame 4). [2]",
129,元,"beginning, former time, origin","“In the beginning…” starts that marvellous shelf of books we call the Bible. It talks about how all things were made, and tells us that when the Creator came to humanity, she made two of them, man and woman. While we presume, she made two of every other animal as well, we are not told as much. Hence two and a pair of human legs come to mean beginning. [4]",ゲン、ガン
130,罙,paper punch,"* paper punch † This primitive simply discards the first stroke of that for hole to become a paper punch. When found at the top of its relative primitive, it undergoes the same change, the eight becoming human legs (see frame 1316). [4]",
131,尤,"reasonable, just, natural, superb",,
132,沈,"sink, be submerged, subside, be depressed, aloes","The technique for sinking used in this kanji is unique. Rather than the biblical image of tying a millstone about the victim’s neck, here we see a crown tied about one leg before the unfortunate party is tossed into the water. [7]",チン、ジン
133,凵,shovel,"* shovel Ô This enclosure—which embraces its relative primitive from the bottom—is a pictograph of the scoop of a shovel. When room permits, the arms are extended upwards to nearly the same height as the relative element it holds. [2]",

138,其,bushel basket,"* bushel basket ¤ As the two legs at the bottom suggest, this bushel basket is a large container, standing on the floor. Its first four strokes indicate that it is made of wicker, much like the small wicker basket treated immediately above. To put something inside of the bushel basket, the legs at the bottom are attached to the final horizontal stroke and extended to make a kind of enclosure. [8]",

By way of exception, you might doodle around with the kanji’s form to see what you can come up with. [5]",ヒ

So many of the previous stories have included people in them that simply to use person for a primitive meaning would be risky. We need to be more specific, to focus on one particular person.

253,衣,"garment, cloak or scarf","* Used as a primitive, the additional meanings of cloak or scarf will come in handy. What has to be noted particularly are the changes in shape the kanji can undergo when it becomes an element in other kanji. In fact, it is the most volatile of all the kanji we shall treat, and for that reason deserves special attention here.

* When it appears to the left, it looks like this: 7, and we shall take it to mean cloak. At the bottom, when attached to the stroke immediately above it, the first two strokes (the top hat) are omitted, giving us: R, which we shall take to mean a scarf.

* On rare occasions, the element can be torn right across the middle, with the first 2 strokes appearing at the top and the last 4 at the bottom of another primitive or cluster of primitives: S, in which cases we shall speak of a top hat and scarf.

* And finally, of course, it can keep its original kanji shape, along with its original meaning of garment in general.

We can join them together by thinking of a three-part story: first a fish is caught and bound up on a line with its unfortunate school-mates; when the fisherman gets home, he cuts off the head and tosses it, with the entrails, out into the rice fields for fertilizer; and the rest he sets in a skillet over a cooking fire for his supper.

304,加,"add, addition, increase, join, include, Canada",Muscles . . . mouth. This is the only case in which the primitive for muscle appears on the left; note should be taken of the fact in composing one’s story. [5],カ
305,木,"tree, wood","Here we see a pictograph of a tree, showing the main trunk in the long vertical stroke and the boughs in the long horizontal stroke. The final two strokes sweep down in both directions to indicate the roots. Although it may look similar at first sight to the kanji for water (frame 130), the order in which it is written is completely different and this affects its final appearance. [4]",ボク、モク
306,术,resin,"This tree has become a pole (that is, a tree with its branches not touching) because most of its branches have been pruned off by a naive but greedy gardener anxious to siphon off its resin (the drop at the top, written as the final stroke) as quickly as possible. [5]",

308,未,"un-, not yet, hitherto, still, even now, sign of the ram, 1-3PM, eighth sign of Chinese zodiac","As the key word suggests, this kanji has to do with something not quite over and done with. More concretely, it shows us a tree that is not yet fully grown. The extra short stroke in the upper branches shows new branches spreading out, leaving one with the feeling that the tree has a ways to go yet before it reaches maturity. In other words, the kanji conveys its meaning pictographically, playing on the earlier pictograph of the tree. [5]",ミ、ビ
309,末,"end, close, tip, powder, posterity","previous frame. The first stroke shows a branch that is longer than the main branch, indicating that the tree has reached the extremity of its growth, so that its branches stop spreading and start drooping downwards. Be sure to keep this imagery in mind, to avoid confusing this key word with synonyms that will appear later. [5]",マツ、バツ
312,禾,wheat,"* wheat M This primitive element will be made to stand for wheat. It connotes a special grain, more expensive than ordinary rice and so reserved for special occasions.

317,米,"rice, USA","* as a primitive, it keeps its meaning of rice, and is meant to connote a very ordinary, commonplace grain, in contrast to the primitive for wheat that we just learned. (This meaning accords well with Japan, where the output of rice far exceeds that of wheat.) It occasionally takes the shape j when it stands on its own, or is joined to a line above. In this case, we shall have it refer specifically to grains of rice. This primitive is not to be confused with the similar-looking primitive for water. While the stroke orders are nearly alike, grains of rice has 5 strokes, while water only has 4 because it joins the second and third strokes into one. Finally, we may note that by itself the kanji for rice is an abbreviation used for the United States, which can then also serve as an alternate reading for the main primitive form, if you so wish.",ベイ、マイ、メエトル

The character for an old man begins with an abbreviation of the character for somebody, the nose having been shortened into a simple crisscross of lines.

The element itself differs from that for grow up only in the extension of the single vertical stroke beneath the final horizontal stroke and in the order of writing.

But time has “double-locked” (the extra stroke through the element for lock) the real secret of this art form from us, and we can only surmise such meanings.

469,呈,"display, offer, present, send, exhibit","The trick to remembering this character lies in associating the key word with the line from the nursery rhyme about 4 and 20 blackbirds baked in a pie: “Wasn’t this a dainty dish to set before the king?” If we think of display in terms of that famous line, and the king with his head thrown back and his mouth wide open as 4 and 20 blackbirds fly in one after the other, we shall have satisfied both the elements and their position. [7]",
470,皇,emperor,"An emperor, as we all know, is a ruler—something like a king but higher in status. The white bird perched above the king, elevating him to imperial heights, is the messenger he sends back and forth to the gods to request advice and special favours, something that white birds have long done in folklore throughout the world.

476,亠,,,
477,亢,whirlwind,"* whirlwind A A formal high silk top hat resting atop a weather vane represents a whirlwind. To keep it distinct from the primitive for wind, try to picture the vortex, or tornado-like spinning movement, of a whirlwind. The next frame should help. [4]",
478,,"tall, high, expensive","Recalling an image from frame 183, first see the mouth under the extra-terrestrial’s glass hood, and then the mouth under the top hat of one of his mates who has tried on the strange earthling’s headgear only to find that it makes him look much, much taller than everyone else.

480,亭,"pavilion, restaurant, mansion, arbor, cottage, vaudeville, music hall, stage name","Think of all the pavilions at some World Expo you attended or followed in the media, and you will no doubt see rising up among them the towering tall crowned nail (the crown being a revolving restaurant)—that architectural monstrosity that has become a symbol of science and technology at such events. [9]",
481,享,"enjoy, receive, undergo, answer (phone), take, get, catch","Tall children receive more attention. Tall children grow up to make better wide receivers. Take your pick, depending on whether you prefer child psychology or American football.

483,京,"capital, 10**16","Think of some tall, domed capital building with swarms of little folk gathered around its base, probably demonstrating for their government’s attention. [8]",

485,罔,net,Gass canopy . . . animal horns . . . perish. [14],
486,冖,crown,"* crown ? This pictograph of a simple crown is distinguished from the roof only by the absence of the chimney (the first drop at the top). It can be used for all the principal connotations of the word crown. We will meet the full character from which this element is derived later on, in frame 304. [2]",
487,軍,chariot,* Used as a primitive this kanji means only chariot.,グン
488,,"study, learning, science","The child in the little red schoolhouse is there for one reason only: to study. Anyone who has gone through the schooling system knows well enough that study is one thing and learning quite another again.

501,矢,"dart, arrow","When shot high into the heavens, the dart gets so small it looks like a mere drop. Although this character could as well mean “arrow,” it has no connection with the primitive of that meaning. Hence the new key word. [5]",シ
502,知,"know, wisdom",Dart . . . mouth. [8],チ
503,矣,sentence particle,Elbow . . . dart. [5],
504,爰,migrating duck,"* migrating ducks £ This primitive is simplicity itself. It depicts bird claws that are joined to one another. Note the extra horizontal stroke in friendship, which gives the appearance of a “two” in the middle of the kanji, further emphasizing the togetherness of the migrating ducks. [9]",
505,宀,house,"* house º This extremely useful primitive element depicts the roof of a house. You can see the chimney at the top and the eaves on either side without much trouble. It is a “crown” element, which means that it is invariably set atop other things. Examples follow immediately. [3]",
506,宣,"proclaim, say, announce","Under the primitive for house we meet the kanji for span. Think of the key word in its religious sense of missionary preaching: “proclaiming the good news to all nations” and “shouting it from the housetops.” That should be enough to help you remember this simple kanji, used in fact both for advertising and missionary work. [9]",セン
507,寄,"draw near, stop in, bring near, gather, collect, send, forward","Let the idea of drawing near suggest something dangerous or eerie that one approaches with fear and trembling. Here we see a strange house—perhaps the haunted House of Usher that Edgar Allen Poe immortalized, or the enchanted Gingerbread House that lured Hansel and Gretel to draw near. [11]",キ

513,复,double back,"* double back M Either the connotations of turning around and heading back during one’s travels, or folding an object in half will do here. It pictures someone doubling back to the nearest inn to lie down and rest a weary pair of walking legs after a full day’s voyage. [9]",
515,無,"nothingness, none, isn’t, nothing, nil, not","This character is the Japanese character for the supreme philosophical principle of much Oriental thought: nothingness. Make use of the oaken tub from the previous frame, and add to that the oven fire at the bottom. [12]",

524,欠,"lack, gap, fail, yawning radical (no. 76)","The pictograph hidden in this character is of someone yawning. The first stroke shows the head thrown back; the second, the arm bent at the elbow as the hand reaches up to cover the mouth; and the last two, the legs. Since yawning shows a lack of something (psychologically, interest; physiologically, sleep), the connection is plain to see. [4]",ケツ、ケン

526,漱,,,
527,艹,flower,"* flower 4 We are not yet equipped with all the pieces necessary to learn the character for flower, so shall have to content ourselves here with the first three strokes, which represent the primitive of the same meaning. Concentrate on the actual “bloom” of the flower, and keep a particular flower in mind. Try a rose, a tulip, or a daisy, since none of them will have their own kanji. [3]",
528,莫,graveyard,"* graveyard, The element shown here should be taken to represent a modern graveyard. Gone are the cobwebs and gnarled trees, the tilted headstones and dark, moonless nights that used to scare the wits out of our childhood imaginations. Instead, we see brightly coloured flowers placed before the tombstones, the sun shining gloriously overhead, and a cuddly St. Bernard sitting at the gate keeping watch. [10]",
529,卉,haystack,"* haystack ; The three needles stacked up give us a haystack (in which it may be harder to find the hay than the needles). In the rare case in which there is nothing underneath this element, as in the following frame, the last three strokes are written virtually the same as two hands—that is, the second stroke sweeps down slightly to the left. [5]",
530,尭,straw man,* straw man # The two human legs added to the haystack (with the horizontal stroke to keep the two parts distinct from one another and avoid an ugly tangle) give us a straw man. [8],
531,竹,bamboo,"Bamboo grows upwards, like a straight nail, and at each stage of its growth (which legend associates with the arrival of the new moon) there is a jointed rootstock (the first stroke). Two such bamboo stalks are pictured here. [6]",チク

533,慢,"ridicule, laziness",State of mind . . . mandala. [14],
534,夢,"dream, vision, illusion",To have a dream after going to bed is really the crown to a perfect evening. The flower petals over the eyes (instead of the “sand” that Westerners are used to finding there when they awake in the morning) only confirms the image of a pleasant dream suggested by the rest of this rather complex kanji.

536,壊,"demolition, break, destroy","The right half of this character shows a garment woven so fine that it can pass through the eye of a needle, fittingly draped around the slithering, ethereal form of a poltergeist.

538,入,"Enter, to go in, to put in, to come in

541,谷,valley,"Go in . . . an umbrella . . . a mouth. Because of space restrictions, the element for go in is shortened in this character. If you stand 2on your head and look at this kanji, the image of a valley stands out more clearly: the mouth of the river whose water flows down at the intersection of the two mountains, with the final two strokes adding the element of perspective. Now get back on your feet again and see if the image still remains clear. If not, then return to the primitives and make a story in the usual way. [7]",コク
542,容,"contain, form, looks",This character depicts a house so large that it can contain an entire valley. [10],ヨウ
543,𠆢,umbrella,"* umbrella 3 The actual character on which this primitive meaning umbrella is based we shall not meet until frame 1026. We may think of it as a large and brightly-coloured beach umbrella. If you compare this with frame 8, you will notice how the two strokes touch here, while the kanji for eight would leave a gaping leak in the top. [2]",
544,亼,meeting,* meeting 5 This compound primitive depicts a meeting as a massive gathering of people under one umbrella. The full kanji from which this derives will be introduced later in frame 752. The important thing here is to picture the scene just described and associate it with the word meeting. [3],
545,今,clock,"* We shall use clock as the primitive meaning of this character, in line with the above explanation.",コン、キン

547,倉,"godown, warehouse, storehouse, cellar, treasury","The single gate is used here not in order to represent one gate, but many of them, indeed a meeting of gates. Add mouth (as an entrance here) and you end up with godown. That should help keep this character distinct from storehouse (frame 589). [10]",ソウ
548,僉,,,
550,兪,"affirmative response, relaxed, at ease",Meeeting . . . flesh . . . stream. [9],
551,龹,quarter,"* quarter } This character simply splits the vertical stroke of a half in half once again, to get a quarter. In so doing, it spreads the split stroke out to form a sort of enclosure under which its main relative primitive will be placed. It can be used either in its substantive or verbal meaning. [6]",
552,巻,"scroll, volume, book, part, roll up, wind up, tie, coil, counter for texts (or book scrolls)","Quarter . . . snake. The key word refers to a manuscript rolled up into a scroll, not to a hanging scroll (frame 407). [9]",

555,発,"departure, discharge, publish, emit, start from, disclose, counter for gunshots","This key word refers to the discharging of guns, trains, people, and even words. The elements: teepee . . . two . . . human legs. Contrast the writing with frame 59. [9]",ハツ、ホツ
556,尞,pup tent,* pup tent r The St. Bernard dog and its overlapping with the element for teepee are enough to suggest the meaning of this primitive element: a pup tent. The combination of sun and little at the bottom can mean a little opening or flap through which the sun shines in the morning to let you know it’s time for getting up. [12],
557,齊,,,
558,㕣,a small valley or gully. [5],"* gully r as an abbreviation of the kanji for a valley, this primitive gets its meaning as a small valley or gully. [5]",
559,⻌,"road-way, street, district, journey, course, moral, teachings","The key word carries both the sense of a road for transit and a way or method of doing something, but the former is better for forming an image. The primitives read: the neck of a road. Think of a crowded road-way where traffic has come to a standstill—what we commonly refer to as a “bottleneck.” [12]",ドウ、トウ
560,廴,stretch,"* stretch o The primitive meaning to stretch might at first seem similar to that for road. Take a moment to study it more carefully and you will see the difference. Like road, this character holds other primitives above its sweeping final stroke. [3]",
561,聿,"brush, finally, self, relate, follow, here, fast, writing brush radical (no. 129)","* brush ¿ This primitive element, not itself a kanji, is a pictograph of a writing brush. Let the first 3 strokes represent the hairs at the tip of the brush, and the following two strokes the thumb and forefinger that guide it when you write. Note how the long vertical stroke, cutting through everything, is drawn last. This is standard procedure when you have such a stroke running the length of a character. However, as we saw in the case of cow, when this primitive appears on top of another primitive, its “tail” is cut off, giving us D. [6]",
562,建,build,"To construct a building, you first draw a set of plans (the writing brush) and then s-t-r-e-t-c-h your drawing out to scale in reality. [9]",ケン、コン
563,乃,a fist,3 4 * The primitive meaning is taken from the pictograph: a fist.,

You may remember it either pictographically or by way of the primitives. [5],
571,反,anti-,Cliff . . . crotch. [4],ハン、ホン、タン、ホ
572,夂,walking legs (jogging or walking in long strides),"* walking legs ## motion,” whether you want to think of them as jogging or walking in long strides, as the shape seems to suggest. Be careful how you write it, with the first two strokes like a stylized “7.” [3]",
573,夏,summer,"In the summer, fatigued by the heat, your head hangs down nearly as far as your walking legs, or rather, your “dragging legs.” Note how the walking legs (instead of “animal legs”) are the only thing that distinguishes this character from that for page (frame 60). [10]",カ、ガ、ゲ
574,各,each,"* The sense of the proverb should help when using this kanji as a primitive; otherwise, reduce it to its original elements. But do not associate it in any way with the word “every,” which we shall meet later in another context.",カク

576,攵,taskmaster,"* taskmaster ß First find the long rod (the first stroke), held in the hand of someone seated (the next 3 strokes, not unlike the pictograph for woman, but quite different from that for walking legs introduced in the last Lesson). The only thing left to do is conjure up the memory of some taskmaster (or taskmistress) from your past whom you will “never forget.” [4]",
577,敝,shredder,"* shredder u The element on the left looks like rice with a belt running through it, but we would do best to think of it in terms of its writing order: little . . . belt . . . little. On the right, of course, the taskmaster. [12]",
578,之,"of, this","This character is now used chiefly in proper names, and is best learned as the character closest to the hiragana N, though in fact it has no relation to it. [3]

 * In order to give this kanji a more concrete meaning when it is used as a primitive ELEMENT, think of it as referring to building blocks with the hiragana written on them, much the same as the A-B-C blocks you played with as a child. 3",シ
579,乏,"destitution, scarce, limited",Drop of . . . building blocks. [4],ボウ
580,弋,,,
581,式,"style, ceremony, rite, function, method, system, form, expression",Take style in its sense of some fashion design or model. Then let the element arrow and craft stand for the well-known style of shirts known as “Arrow shirts” because of the little arrow sewn on each one. [6],シキ
582,,"II, two, second","We use the Roman numeral ii here to stress that this kanji is an older form of the kanji for two. Think of two arrows in a quiver, standing up like the numeral ii. [6]",ニ、 ジ
583,戈,"halberd, arms, festival car, float, tasselled spear radical (no. 62)","* fiesta O The picture in this primitive is what we may call a “tassled arrow.” A decorative tassle is strung on the shaft of an arrow to indicate that it is no longer a weapon but a symbol of a fiesta. As before, the first stroke is extended when it serves as a semienclosure. [4]",カ
584,絨,wool cloth,"To use the thread attached to the needle and make the safe of wool, in other words, WOOL CLOTH",
585,我,"ego, I, selfish, our, oneself","Hand . . . fiesta. Note how the second stroke of the hand is stretched across to double up as the first stroke of the tasseled arrow we use for fiesta. Compare this kanji with frames 17, 36, and 525. [7]",ガ

587,𢦏,Thanksgiving,"* Thanksgiving F I choose the word Thanksgiving as only one possible way of making this primitive more concrete. The sense, as its composite primitives make clear, is of a “land fiesta,” or a harvest feast. If you choose a word of your own, make sure it does not conflict with fiesta. [6]",
588,戊,"5th calendar sign, parade","* parade ¨ Note first the order of the writing. The first stroke, added to fiesta, gives us a full-fledged enclosure, because of which we should always think of this as a parade of something or other, namely whatever is inside the enclosure. [5]",ボ、ボウ
589,成,"turn into, become, get, grow, elapse, reach",Let the phrase “turn into” suggest some sort of a magical change. What happens here is that the parade marching down main street turns into a dagger-throwing bout between competing bands. Note how only one stroke has to be added to make the change. [6],セイ、ジョウ
590,戌,marching (The inclusion of the one gives the sense of the singlemindedness and unity of the group  joined in the march),"* march R As distinct from the parade, the march points to a formal demonstration, whose emotions are generally a far cry from the happy spirit of the parade. The inclusion of the one gives the sense of the singlemindedness and unity of the group joined in the march. As was the case with parade, the primitive inside the enclosure indicates who or what is marching. [6]",
591,武,"warrior, military, chivalry, arms","With a quiver of arrows set on one’s back, the goal of the warrior depicted here is not to attack but merely to stop the attack of others: the oldest excuse in history! [8]",ブ、ム
592,讖,,,
593,㦮,float,"* float G The floats that are such an important part of a fiesta are shown here by the addition of the two extra horizontal strokes, which you may take as a quasi-pictographic representation of the platform structure of a float. [6]",
594,叔,"uncle, youth",Above . . . little . . . crotch. [8],シュク
595,止,"stop, footprint","* Although the meaning of stop will be retained, we will return often to the pictographic meaning of footprint.",シ
596,歩,"walk, counter for steps",Footprints that follow one another a few at a time indicate walking. [8],ホ、ブ、フ
598,正,"correct, justice, righteous, 10**40","“A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step,” says the Chinese proverb. Here we see one footprint, complementing that proverb with the sound advice that if the first step is not made correctly, the whole point of the journey will be forfeited. This is the ideal that teachers are supposed to have in correcting their students, and parents in correcting their children. [5]",
599,𤴓,mending (正+ 人),"* mending H This primitive differs from the kanji for correct only by the movement added to the last two strokes, the “-ing” of mending if you will. But take a more concrete sense, like mending holes in socks. [5]",
600,定,"determine, fix, establish, decide","Determination, in the sense of settling on a certain course of action, is likened here to mending one’s house. [8]",テイ、ジョウ
601,走,run,"Running, we are told here, mends the soil. Observe in the following frames how this kanji can embrace other elements from below, much the same way as the element for road does; and how, in order to do this, the final stroke needs to be lengthened. [7]",ソウ
602,是,"just so, this, right, justice","In this kanji we are shown someone spending an entire day at mending one stocking, because they want the job done “just so.” Be sure to make a clear image of a finicky old fusspot to make the abstract idea as concrete as possible. [9]",ゼ、 シ
603,疋,"use this for animals in general, we will refer to it as
a zoo","* zoo Ð Rather than use this for animals in general, we will refer to it as a zoo, to avoid confusion with the other animals that will be showing up. Except for the downward hook at the end of the first stroke, this element is indistinguishable from mending. Perhaps by now you have developed a quick eye for such details. If not now, you will before long. [5]",
604,,,,
605,制,"system, law, rule","This kanji show a unique system for leading cows to the slaughterer’s sabre: one ties a belt about their waist and fixes that belt to an overhead cable, pulling the cow up into the air where it hangs suspended, helpless against the fate that awaits it. [8]",セイ

619,,"abandon, throw away, discard, resign, reject, sacrifice",Infant . . . buckle (see frame 415) . . . tree. [13],キ
620,育,"bring up, grow up, raise, rear","Since the key word has to do with raising children to be strong both in mind and body, it is easy to coordinate the primitive elements: infant . . . meat. [8]",イク
621,允,"license, sincerity, permit",Elbow . . . human legs. [4],イン
622,𠫔,wall,* wall h The elbow hanging under a ceiling will become our element for a wall. [3],
625,至,"climax, arrive, proceed, reach, attain, result in","Wall . . . soil. The key word allows for the full variety of connotations: to peak, to arrive at the end, and the like. [6]",
626,屋,"roof, house, shop, dealer, seller","Flag . . . climax. Since this kanji has no relation to the primitive for roof, we cannot use it as a primitive in the next frame. [9]",
627,云,rising cloud,"* rising cloud ° This primitive is meant to depict in graphic fashion a cloud of something or other rising upwards, like vapor or smoke or dust. [4]",ウン
628,北,north,"The cold air from the north is so strong that we see two people sitting on the ground back to back, their arms interlocked so they don’t blow away. (Pay special attention to the drawing of the first 3 strokes.) [5]",ホク

630,東,Both the direction east and the part of the world called “the East”,* Both the direction east and the part of the world called “the East” are primitive meanings of this character.,トウ
631,闌,,Gates . . . east. [20],
632,束,"bundle, sheaf, ream, tie in bundles, govern, manage, control","In the same way that we saw the sun in the tree in the kanji for east, here we see a square container in the shape of a mouth. [7]",ソク
633,疎,"alienate, rough, neglect, shun, sparse, penetrate",Zoo . . . bundle. Note that the element for zoo is flattened out on the left just as leg (frame 1279) had been. This is the only time we will meet this form in this book. [12],ソ、 ショ
634,頼,"trust, request",Bundle . . . head. [16],ライ
635,西,west,"* as a primitive, the meaning of west can be expanded to refer to the Old West of cowboy-movie fame, just as the meaning of the character for east was expanded into the East.

Note, however, that in its primitive form the legs are straightened out and reach down to the bottom of the mouth. Hence, we get the shape º. With the exception of one kanji, given in the following frame, this element always appears at the top of its relative primitives.",セイ、 サイ、 ス
636,価,"value, price",Person . . . Old West. [8],
637,要,"need, main point, essence, pivot, key to",Old West . . . woman. [9],ヨウ
638,票,"ballot, label, ticket, sign",Old West . . . altar. [11],ヒョウ

640,酉,whiskey bottle,"* as a primitive, it means whiskey bottle. In its pictograph, you can see the loosely corked lid, the bottle and the contents (about one-third full). You might also hink of the Spanish “porrón,” a decanter shaped like a long-necked bird.",ユウ
641,奠,,,
642,奐,,,
643,乍,saw,* saw ¼ The saw in this primitive is distinguished from the primitive for ax by the extra “teeth” on the blade. [5],
644,彡,shape,"* shape ‰ The three simple strokes of this element actually represent the form or shape of the hair of one’s beard. But we keep the simple sense of a shape, or its verb “to shape,” in order to avoid confusion later when we meet an element for hair. When using this element, be sure to visualize yourself shaping the thing in question, or better still, twisting it out of shape. [3]",
645,彦,"lad, boy (ancient)",Vase . . . cliff . . . shape. [9],ゲン
646,参,"nonplussed, three (in documents), going, coming, visiting, visit, be defeated, die, be madly in love, participate, take part in",Elbow . . . St. Bernard dog . . . shape. [8]4,サン、シン
647,參,,,
648,勿,"not, must not, do not, be not","First take the primitive meaning of this character: knot. Think of it as the piglet minus its body (the horizontal stroke), that is, the curly tail that looks like a knot. as an exception, we will use the homonym to remember the abstract key word, not. [4]",

650,匆,"rush, hurry",Knot . . . cut. [8],
651,,piggy bank,"* piggy bank , This very helpful primitive element is worth the few moments it takes to learn it. Just remember that each day you put a few pennies into the back of the little piglet on your bureau that you call a piggy bank. [9]",
652,湯,"hot water, bath, hot spring",Water . . . piggy bank. [12],トウ
653,豕,sow,* sow [ Let this primitive represent a fat sow. Easier than pulling it apart into smaller elements is remembering its shape as a highly stylized pictograph. Practice its 7 strokes a few times before going on to examples of its use in the next six frames. [7],
654,家,"house, home, family, professional, expert, performer","This is the full character whose primitive form we learned already. To help a little, this kanji recalls the times when the “domestic” animals were, as the word itself suggests, really kept in the house. Hence: house . . . sow. [10]",カ、ケ
655,蒙,,,
656,而,comb,* comb ¾ The pictograph of a comb is clearly visible in this primitive element. [6],
657,喘,"pant, gasp, breathe hard",,
658,需,"demand, request, need",The sense of demand is best captured by thinking of the economic principle of “supply and demand.” The primitives: rain . . . comb. [14],ジュ
659,半,"half, middle, odd number, semi-, part-","Although the writing order is different, one can remember the appearance of this character by seeing it as a little needle—the kind used for splitting hairs in half. (Again, according to rule, little takes a stroke beneath it in order to be placed over an element that has no horizontal line at the top.) [5]",ハン
661,亥,acorn,"* The top hat represents the external shape of the acorn, and the unusual but easily written complex of strokes beneath it (which you might also see as distortions of an elbow and person) stands for the mysterious secret whereby the acorn contains the oak tree in a nutshell.",
662,門,gate,"* as a primitive, we shall continue to give it the meaning of gates, but recommend the image of swinging doors (like the kind once common at entrances to saloons) to distinguish it from the primitive for door.",モン
663,間,"interval, space","Gates . . . sun/day. This interval applies to time and space alike, but the latter is better for creating an image. [12]",カン、ケン

665,尋,"inquire, fathom, look for",Broom . . . craft . . . mouth . . . glue. [12],

668,争,"contend, dispute, argue",Bound up . . . rake. [6],ソウ
669,唐,"T'ang, China, foreign","The key word here refers of course to the T’ang Dynasty in China (and not to the name of the drink astronauts take with them into outer space, though this could be useful for the next frame). Its elements: cave . . . rake . . . mouth. [10]",トウ
670,隶,sieve,"* sieve z A rake and the grains of rice at the bottom give us a hint of winnowing, which relates clearly to the meaning of a sieve. [8]",
671,剥,"come off, peel, fade, discolor",Sieve . . . spear. [10],
672,尹,mop,* mop Õ The only thing distinguiinges a mop from a rake is the bent handle that does not cut through the top horizontal stroke. It depicts the swish-swash motion of a mop. [4],
673,君,"mister, you, ruler, male name suffix",The somewhat highbrow British term of address is chosen here to represent the kanji for a form of address used towards one’s juniors. It is composed of: mop . . . mouth. [7],クン
674,丑,"sign of the ox or cow, 1-3AM, second sign of Chinese zodiac",[4],
675,井,"well, well crib, town, community","Recalling that there are no circular strokes, and that the shape of the square and the square within a square (frame 586) have already been used, it should be relatively easy to see how this character can be consider a pictograph of a well. [4]",
676,共,together,"* The primitive retains the meaning of together. Imagine things strung together like fish on a line, beads on a thread, or whatever. The main thing is to avoid putting them in a straight row, which would confound this element with the previous one. As we saw with bushel basket, this primitive can join its legs to the final horizontal stroke and stretch them to form an enclosure.",キョウ
677,異,"uncommon, different, queerness, strangeness, wonderful, curious, unusual",Brains . . . together. [11],イ
678,暴,"outburst, rave, fret, force, violence, cruelty, outrage",Sun . . . strung together . . . rice grains. [15],ボウ、バク
679,升,"measuring box, 1.8 liter","This is the character for the little wooden box that the Japanese use for measuring things, as well as for drinking saké out of. Simply imagine the outside as spiked with a thousand sharp needles, and the quaint little measuring box becomes a drinker’s nightmare! Be very careful when you write this character not to confuse it with the writing of thousand. The reason for the difference gives us a chance to clarify another general principle of writing that supersedes the one we mentioned in frame 4: when a single stroke runs vertically through the middle of a character, it is written last. [4]",ショウ
680,开,"a union of two hands, both of which are used at the same time.

Whenever this element appears at the bottom of its relative primitive, the top line is omitted, whether or not there is a horizontal line to replace it.","* two hands b Let this primitive represent a union of two hands, both of which are used at the same time.

682,刑,"punish, penalty, sentence, punishment",Two hands . . . sabre. [6],ケイ

684,手,a single hand all by itself,* Keep to the etymology when using this kanji as a primitive: a single hand all by itself.,シュ、ズ
685,扌,fingers,* fingers − This alternate form of the primitive for hand we shall use to represent finger or fingers. It always appears at the left. [3],
686,毛,"fur, hair, feather, down","This character simply reverses the direction of the final stroke of hand to produce fur. If you reverse your hand and put its palm down, you will have the side on which fur grows. [4]",モウ
687,毟,,,
688,毳,,,
689,乇,lock of hair,"* lock of hair 6 This element is clearly derived from that for fur. By leaving out the second stroke, we get simply a lock of hair. [3]",
690,宅,"home, house, residence, our house, my husband",House . . . lock of hair. [6],
691,耳,ear,"The pictograph for the ear looks much like that for eye, but note how the stroke order gives it a different look. [6]",ジ

693,最,"utmost, most, extreme",Sun . . . take. [12],サイ、シュ
694,聶,,,
695,心,it appears beneath or to the right of its relative primitive and means the physical organ of the heart.,"* as a primitive, it can take three forms, to which we shall assign three distinct meanings. * In its kanji-form, it appears beneath or to the right of its relative primitive and means the physical organ of the heart.",シン
696,⺖,"busy, occupied, restless",State of mind . . . perish. [6],ボウ、モウ
697,,"pining, yearn for, love dearly, adore",Graveyard . . . valentine. Note carefully the stroke order of the valentine primitive. [14],ボ
698,必,"invariably, certain, inevitable","First note the stroke order of this character, which did not really evolve from the heart, even though we take it that way. If one takes it as a pictograph “dividing” the heart in half, then one has one of those invariably true bits of human anatomy: the fact that each heart is divided into two halves. [5]",ヒツ
699,足,"leg, foot, be sufficient, counter for pairs of footwear",Mouth . . . mending. Note that the last stroke of mouth and the first of mending overlap. [7],ソク
700,路,"path, route, road, distance",Wooden leg . . . each. [13],ロ、 ル
701,骨,"skeleton, bone, remains, frame","This kanji and primitive refer to the part of the body composed of the bones and their joints. The top part of the kanji, terminating in the element for crown, is a pictograph of a bone joint. I leave it to you to put the pieces together, so to speak. [10]",コツ
702,咼,jawbone,* jawbone ‚ The meaning of this primitive is taken from the combination of “the joint” above and the mouth in the cowl below. [9],
703,才,genie,"* + , * The primitive meaning, genie, derives from the roots of the word genius. Use the genie out in the open when the primitive appears to the right of or below its relative primitive; in that case it also keeps its same form. At the left, the form is altered to c, and the meaning becomes a genie in the bottle. 2",サイ
704,,"exist, outskirts, suburbs, located in",Genie in the bottle . . . soil. [6],ザイ
705,,"length, ten shaku, measure, Mr., Ms., height, stature, all (one has), only, that's all, merely","The length whose measure this kanji depicts extends from the tip of one hand to the tip of the other with arms at full length. Notice the final stroke, which cuts across the vertical second stroke to distinguish it from large (frame 107). [3]",ジョウ
706,史,"history, chronicle",A mouth . . . tucked under the arm. [5],シ
707,更,grow late,The implication behind the meaning of grow late is that things are changing in the same way that the day turns into night. The elements: ceiling . . . sun . . . tucked under the arm. [7],コウ
708,卩,,,
709,卸,wholesale,"The left primitive is a union of a horse and footprint. To the right, the stamp. [9]",シャ
710,マ,"traffic, pass through, avenue, commute, counter for letters, notes, documents, etc.","Chop-seal . . . utilize . . . road. By combining the first two primitives into a single image, you will be able to use that image in a few instances later, one of which comes immediately. [10]",ツウ、ツ

712,令,"orders, laws, command, decree, good",Meeting . . . chop-seal. [5],レイ

716,留,"detain, fasten, halt, stop",Receipt . . . dagger . . . rice field. [10],リュウ、ル
717,𠀉,staples,"* staples ‹ This primitive represents a number of small staples, like the kind commonly used in an office and at school. [4]",
718,段,"grade, steps, stairs","The kanji connoting rank or class shows us a new element on the left: the familiar primitive for staples with an additional stroke cutting through the vertical stroke. It is easiest in these cases to make a primitive related to what we already know. Hence, we call it a staple gun. To the right, missile. [9]",ダン、タン
719,臼,"mortar, bomb",,キュウ、 グ
